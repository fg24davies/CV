# Profile

A career changer and recent graduate from the Makers Academy 16-week bootcamp. An academic background in Physics, I love solving problems and figuring out how to make something work! Whether that be solving kata or a cryptic crossword, creating an app to help manual processs or building something ou. 
I have spent time exploring what sort of environment I like to work in and growing my skillset.
I knew I always wanted to do something that used my brain in the way

### Problem-Solver 
I am an analytical thinker
Busy restaurants have a number of unforeseen problems that arise. As manager, I felt confident in finding logical solutions calmly. In programming, I found problem-solving to be a key skill for debugging and being able to think rationally when something is not working. - Asking questions is a very important skill in development for ensuring the solution solves the problem presented. I have learnt this skill from my teaching experience; liaising with the parent and the child to really understand what the student needs so I could plan my lessons accordingly. This led to successful results, students getting into top UK schools and achieving high exam results.
 - I have always been an analytical thinker; in my degree I would analyse data and provide formal reports of the results.  for my dissertation created a model and spent time analysing the results in order to discern patterns between two sets of data. At Makers, I continued to use this skill 

### Team Player 
I value open and friendly communication within the team; ensuring all team members are aware of each other's emotions and challenges is important for mitigating conflicts and  creating a productive environment. Makers team experience --- final project ? Working in a team f.

### Communicator
As a restaurant manager I communicated with my staff, suppliers, customers on a daily basis. I feel confident in being able to communicate with a wide range of people At Makers I used these communication skills to lead team stand ups and retros. I presented the technical demo of two team projects to my cohort and wider audience, answering questions confidently. 
Enjoyed teaching, communicate with someone how to do something

### Empathizer
I create a personalized approach to everyone and am able to see their differences and specialties.  As a teaching assistant, it was my job to understand student‚Äôs particular struggles, responding with a kind and patient manner meant I could design a program of work for them to help them reach their full potential.
