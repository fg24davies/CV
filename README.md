# Profile

A career changer and recent graduate from the Makers Academy 16-week bootcamp. An academic background in Physics, I love solving problems and figuring out how to make something work! Whether that be solving kata or a cryptic crossword, creating an app to help manual processs or building something ou. 
I have spent time exploring what sort of environment I like to work in and growing my skillset.
I knew I always wanted to do something that used my brain in the way

Logical problem solver

I have a methodical approach to solving problems, which I employed regularly throughout my Physics degree. This was the case for both practical and theoretical work; determining why an experimental set up was not work or calculating the solution to a complex mathematical problem. Being an analtyical thinker, I am able to break down a complex problem into small, simple steps from which to build a solution.
I have applied my problem solving skills throughout learning to code. Break down complex requirements into small and simple steps and build a solution this way. I have taken external code reviews to continue to improve my problem solving process in code.

### Problem-Solver 
 

I am an analytic thinker and 

I have naturally developed problem solving skills from studying maths up to degree level which I have utilised when coding. Particularly I enjoy writing algorithms in my spare time indepdendently which required a lot of perseverance, but has improved my debugging and testing skills (examples Python and Ruby). During my time at Makers I have taken several external reviews and have used feedback to improve my ability to TDD and refactor code.

Degree


Makers - taking big problems/ or tasks and breaking them down into small simple steps, looking at them in a number of different ways in order to come up with a solution.





### Communicator

I have confident communication skills thanks to my experience in people-facing roles in hospitality and teaching. Whilst volunteering in after-school teaching to gain experience, I had a student who‚Äôs reading age was slipping. The parents had noticed that they were no longer reading at home or completing their reading record. Communication was key here in understanding where the problem lay; spending time talking to the student to learn as much about their reading and asking the parents questions for more insight. I understood that it was not that the student was uninterested in reading but that the material was repetitive and I expressed my opinions to the parents. I was then able to plan a solution more effectively to re-engage the student and with the parents' support. This led to a renewed enthusiasm for reading and the student‚Äôs reading record being completed every day. Asking questions and communicating openly are the first steps to solving a problem and I am pleased that Lingumi values this so highly.

As a restaurant manager I communicated with my staff, suppliers, customers on a daily basis. I feel confident in being able to communicate with a wide range of people At Makers I used these communication skills to lead team stand ups and retros. I presented the technical demo of two team projects to my cohort and wider audience, answering questions confidently. 
Enjoyed teaching, communicate with someone how to do something

Learning so much new technology, workshops, pair programming, understanding the requirements, coaches give us a specification, communicate with them to break down what the want, 
Reviews, learning to communicate my process to who I am working with


### Team Player 

I am a good teamplayer and strongly believe everyone has something to contribute to a team. Whilst working as a restaurant manager, I have seen how much teamwork matters in delivering a good product (in this case a pleasant dining experience). You cannot work all shifts at a restaurant and situations will always arise when you are not there. I was keen that all the staff, including myself, could learn from each other‚Äôs experience and I created a channel so that staff could share how they handled a certain situation or their knowledge of a new dish. I also ensured I worked at least one shift with each team member and so that there was a regular opportunity for me to receive and give feedback. This meant the entire team learnt more quickly and felt supported; our staff turnover was low and our team worked cohesively, in turn providing better customer experience. I am very much team-oriented in work and life; celebrating the wins together and valuing the entire team‚Äôs output over personal successes.

I value open and friendly communication within the team; ensuring all team members are aware of each other's emotions and challenges is important for mitigating conflicts and  creating a productive environment. Makers team experience --- final project ? Working in a team f

### Empathizer
I create a personalized approach to everyone and am able to see their differences and specialties.  As a teaching assistant, it was my job to understand student‚Äôs particular struggles, responding with a kind and patient manner meant I could design a program of work for them to help them reach their full potential. 

- working in a team with people from different backgrounds and people's various motivations and levels of experience. Empathy played a huge part in our team projects at Makers,

## Interests

### Playing ‚öΩ 
I love being active and playing sports - football, tennis, skiing, cycling, swimming (cold water!), walking you name it! I played county level Netball at school and now I play football: for a mixed casual 5-a-side and women's 11-a-side. I am an Arsenal fan.
 
### Making ‚úÇÔ∏è
Pottery: I've been part of a pottery studio for the last 3 years where I make and sell functional pottery. I espeically enjoy throwing on the wheel 
Sewing/Knitting: Making clothes and textiles.
Woodwork: I recently made my first piece of furniture.

### Puzzling üîç
Solving and writing cryptic crosswords, playing cards and games.

### Travelling üöû
When possible, I enjoy visiting new places. Highlights include travelling to Georgia by train to hike in the Caucasus Mountains in 2018 and a 10-day cycle trip down the west coast of Ireland in 2019.
